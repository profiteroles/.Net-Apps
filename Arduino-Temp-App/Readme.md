<h2>Arduino Temp Control App</h2>

<div>
This is probably the most exciting application I have ever done during my software course.<br>
I have coded Arduino Uno connected with my .NET form app wher I could control the arduino.<br>
I program fetches the data from Arduino to provide temperature and humidity in the air.<br
The Idea behind this app is actually control air conditioning system in the building or home.<br>
